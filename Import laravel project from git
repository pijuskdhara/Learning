------Error resolving
On step 2, if error occurs:
Run>> composer update
This command worked for my php 6  and laravel lower than version 8

---Error 2--------
Error: Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 8.0.2". You are running "something else"
Solution:
a. Go to file: /vendor/composer/platform-check.json
b. Check the version by printing PHP_VERSION_ID
c. Check the version of php using command: php -v
d. If both are different, remove the php version of PHP_VERSION_ID
    command to remove php 7: 
      apt-get purge php7.*
    Restart apache followed by
      systemctl restart apache2
